								Learn About TOD
							</p>
							<p class="hm2"> Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is a strategy for developing residential and commercial areas in places that are already accessible by public transit, in ways that reduce congestion, improve affordability, support ridership, and create neighborhoods where people want to live. 
							</p>
						</br>
							<p class = "hm2">
							The Boston region is transit-rich, with 25% of housing units and 37% of employment within a half-mile of a rapid transit or commuter rail station, and every day sees new growth around stations.  However, achieving sustainable and equitable TOD in the Boston region requires varied strategies. Defining these strategies requires a detailed understanding of factors such as land use, demographics, and development plans in existing station areas. Fortunately, much has been learned over the last few decades about what does and does not work, the components of successful TOD, and how to measure outcomes and impacts.

							The resources below provide a general introduction to TOD, and information on some of MAPC’s current efforts to support TOD in the region.

						</p>
					</br>
						<p class="hm2">
						TOD is an exciting strategy to many stakeholders in part because it is presents an alternative to the car-dependent, energy-intensive way communities have been built over the past several decades.  An essential element of a successful TOD is that people who live or work in the station area actually use transit as their mode of choice.  This report explores the actual behavior and motivation of TOD residents, employees, and employers in their mode choice.  It includes a detailed literature review and original data on residential trip generation and parking behavior in TODs, and identifies best practices to promote, maintain, and improve TOD-related transit ridership.

						The Healthy Neighborhoods Equity Fund (HNEF) is a proposed $30 million private equity fund designed to transform neighborhoods, support health, and promote regional equity.  This Health Impact Assessment (HIA), undertaken by MAPC, uses three TOD projects in the City of Boston to examine the potential health impacts that could result from investments made by the HNEF. While the goal of this HIA was to help define successful HNEF investments in terms of health outcomes, the HIA approach can also inform developers and investors more broadly about a full range of changes that can result from TOD projects in general.  Additional health-related data can be accessed at http://ourhealthymass.org/. (2013, 105 pp.)

						<p class="hm2">
						Growth in downtown Melrose, MA and around its transit stations has been taking place for decades, but new development pressures are creating the need to look at how and where additional growth can be accommodated while maintaining the character of the community. The Tremont/Essex Street Corridor provides excellent access to the downtown, nearby schools, recreational opportunities, and transit, creating a corridor that is both desirable and an appropriate location for additional housing and mixed-use development. Building upon the existing transit assets in Melrose, MAPC and the City embarked on a planning process for the Tremont/Essex Street Corridor. This final report outlines a series of recommendations based on the core concepts of successful TOD, along with short- and long-term actions to capitalize on opportunities for, and overcome impediments to, investment in the Corridor.

						The City of Quincy, MA benefits in many ways from having four MBTA Red Line rapid rail stations within its borders. Growth and development in Quincy Center and many of the city’s neighborhood business districts occurred well before the extension of the Red Line, but transit has played a key role in the way the City has re-envisioned the future of the areas around the stations. Transit access is one critical component in attracting new development, infrastructure and investment to an area and is clearly embodied in the ongoing revitalization of Quincy Center. Building upon the existing transit assets in Quincy, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) in partnership with the City embarked on a neighborhood planning process to identify the opportunities and impediments in Wollaston Center and develop an action-oriented plan for Re-Envisioning Wollaston.

						This report summarizes MAPC’s evaluation of the possible benefits and impacts associated with the extension of the Green Line into Somerville and Medford, two Massachusetts cities just outside of, but seamlessly linked to, the city of Boston.  MAPC undertook this analysis for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation well before funding had been secured to make the extension a reality.  MAPC was asked to analyze the potential for land use, zoning, and development changes, and to estimate future economic development benefits that could be derived from those changes. While benefits are anticipated for both cities and their residents, impacts such as additional traffic, added pressure on parking, and increased housing costs are also possible. The recommendations in this report were informed by input from both cities, key stakeholders in the area, and a series of public meetings. (2012, 83 pp.)
