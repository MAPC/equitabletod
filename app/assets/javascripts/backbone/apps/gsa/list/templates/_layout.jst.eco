								The Boston area is among the most transit-oriented regions in
								the country, with 25% of housing units and 37% of employment
								within a half-mile of a rapid transit or commuter rail station.
								In other words, a large proportion of our residents and jobs are
								already located in station areas. With major bus stations
								included in consideration, the figures are even higher.

								Currently, as in many parts of the country, Metro Boston is
								experiencing a new wave of growth near transit as municipalities
								and State agencies take steps to unlock the development
								potential of transit station areas. As the supply and demand
								sides of the TOD market grow, there is a clear need to establish
								standards and guidelines for successful station areas. The
								intensity, mix, and phasing of development that may make sense
								in one kind of station area and maximize its TOD potential may
								not work in another station area with other characteristics.
								With over 250 rapid transit and commuter rail stations in the
								MBTA system, there is no one-size-fits-all approach.

								The typology created by MAPC offers developers, local planners,
								funders, and community stakeholders a way to understand the
								regionâ€™s station areas and their potential. The typology
								identifies ten different station area types based on a detailed
								analysis of existing conditions and the nature and magnitude of
								potential development over the next few decades.

								The transit station area typology can help advance equitable and
								sustainable TOD in a variety of ways:
							</p>
							<br />
						</div>
						<p></p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Housing, economic development, and infrastructure programs can
								use the typology to establish funding criteria that reflect both
								local conditions as well as regional TOD goals.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								Analysis of TOD financing needs and the design of potential new
								TOD finance products can acknowledge the distinct station area
								types and the different finance/market conditions that exist in
								each one.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								Technical assistance from MAPC and other partners can be
								targeted to station areas with strong potential for TOD but few
								developments in the pipeline.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								Municipalities and stakeholders can use the analysis to evaluate
								specific development proposals against the range of densities
								and project attributes appropriate for the station area type.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								The MBTA can use the analysis of TOD potential to plan for
								capacity expansion or to evaluate the potential development
								impacts of service changes.
							</li>
