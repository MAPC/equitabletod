The Portal provides a wealth of information for communities, planners, and businesses to better understand their individual station areas, compare them across the region, and find opportunities for investment.  The Portal also houses information on two key tools developed to help the region’s stakeholders understand their station areas: the eTOD rating system and a Typology of station areas.</p>
