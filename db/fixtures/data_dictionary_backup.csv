1,MAPC Region,MAPC,Identifies whether a station area is within MAPC's regional boundary,"The Metropolitan Area Planning Council actively supports planning, analysis, and policy development to support successful TOD. MAPC estimates that transit station areas in the region could accommodate 76,000 new housing units and more than 130,000 jobs near transit in the coming next 25 years.  These goals are now being used to inform the design of TOD finance tools and to guide MAPC technical assistance to cities and towns.","MAPC undertook an analysis of cities and towns across the state to identify a set of basic community types based on their land use and housing patterns, recent growth trends and projected development patterns. Five primary types were then refined further, yielding a total of nine sub-types (a tenth sub-type was added later).  The numerical codes for the five primary types are Inner Core (1), Regional Urban Centers (2), Maturing Suburbs (3), Developing Suburbs (4), and Rural Towns (5).",None,1,2014-03-19 21:14:23.726053,2014-03-19 21:14:23.726053
2,Community Type,COMM_TYP,Numerical code and name of municipality's community type,"Community Types can be used to understand the diversity of communities in the state, better evaluate how demographic, economic, land use, energy, and transportation trends affect those communities, and create policy and planning strategies to help those communities develop in ways their residents desire.",How to interpret goes here How to interpret goes here How to interpret goes here How to interpret goes here,"For details on the methods used to generate the community types and sub-types, please see http://www.mapc.org/sites/default/files/Massachusetts_Community_Types_-_July_2008.pdf",2,2014-03-19 21:14:23.726053,2014-03-19 21:14:23.726053
3,Municipality,MUNI,Name and code number of municipality in which the station is located,"The station areas for which InformaⓉion Station provides data are located in 91 different municipalities in the Boston region.  Each municipality has different growth projections, demographics, character, transportation assets, and travel patterns, all of which can impact station area development.","Some municipalities are more active than others in planning, analysis, and policy development to create successful TODs.  For example, many municipalities have adapted their zoning code to create clear guidelines for more concentrated, mixed-use development within station areas.  These “zoning overlays,” as they are sometimes called, are an important tool to allow TODs to evolve while preserving the character of surrounding areas—something that is often important to existing stakeholders.",None,3,2014-03-19 21:14:23.726053,2014-03-19 21:14:23.726053
